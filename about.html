                    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                    <p>My name is Collin DeForest, as of right now I am a 20yr old student attending Western Washington University and a pre-major in the Computer Science Department. I grew up playing lots of sports from Wrestling, Soccer, Track & Field, Cross Country and Dancing etc. I also did lots of camping with my Boy Scout Troop and have been all over the country because of it. </p>
                    <h3>Where I am from?</h3>
                    <p>I was born and raised in a city known as Bremerton in the state of Washington in Kitsap County. Like most of west Washington it is heavily forrested and along the Puget Sound. If there is one thing you can expect when being there, it is that the weather is everchanging so in short always prepare for rain.</p>
                    <h3>My Goals</h3>
                    <p>My main goal right now is to complete my education at WWU, and to begin working in the industry to gain experience in computer science. I also want to get out in to the world, and learn more about the world we live in, there are so many places to go and see.</p>
